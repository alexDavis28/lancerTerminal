title: Shipment 581

Report a81-0lP-2wv

Shipment 581 contained unstabilised veloxutare being sent to the planet Yibos for stabilisation and further observation. Unfortunately, a breach in security lead to the ship being overrun within an hour.

All 27 members of the crew perished before SSC could arrive. Clean up was swift, however two creatures remain on the ship. It is unclear if they are members of the crew, or a highly mutated plant as SSC only recovered 23 bodies.

Order granted by [Director Hamsin] not to exterminate creatures and instead await observation. This will be beneficial to measure combat efficiency. Governing bodies [Igori] and [Fendra] of [House Sand] have been notified.
