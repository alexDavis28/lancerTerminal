title: Veloxutare

Over the past few months we have seen an improvement in the product veloxutare amongst many lab experiments and a couple field experiments. Significant findings have been listed below:

- Radiation of the Xenoglossia flower must be kept below 60 Gy in order to maintain the structural integrity of DNA. Anything above can lead to rapid mutations once synthesised, which may be beneficial in desperate situations but can be difficult to control. See [ Shipment 581] for more information.

- Recent developments suggest that the inclusion of T-12 into Veloxutare stabilises the V-1 component, allowing for easier transportation.

- House Smoke will readily supply T-12, however they must be kept under the illusion that we are manufacturing terraforming agents.

Full deployment of the product should be ready in time for the house games.

In case of emergency, an antidote has been created and can be located at the lab on Tilimsan.
